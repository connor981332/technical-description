    <h1>What is an SSD?</h1>
    <p>
      An SSD, or <em>solid state drive</em> is a storage medium used in computer
      hardware. What sets apart an SSD from other storage mediums, is it's complete
      lack of moving parts, hence the phrase <em>"solid state".</em>

      The purpose of an SSD (or any other storage medium) is to serve as a place
      where your computer can store the information it needs to function. The performance
      and reliability of a computer's storage plays a big role in the entire computer'
      performance and reliability.

    <h1>Why would I want an SSD?</h1>
      <h2>An SSD is the next generation of computer data storage, with significant advances to its predecessor: the Hard Disk Drive.</h2>
        <h2>No Moving Parts</h2>
          <p>The old storage medium, a hard disk drive, would write data magnetically to spinning platters using heads.  By removing these heads and platters, and switching to integrated circuit boards there is a significant increase to speed and data integrity.</p>
          <p>Hard disk drives were susceptible to mechanical failures, where parts would break, and often would scratch the platters. Scratches would corrupt tha data, and would often be hard to detect.  With no moving parts, there are no mechanical failures.</p>
          <p>In addition, hard disk drives could only store data as fast as the platters could spin and the heads could move.  Removing these parts allows the data to be stored as fast as the data is transmitted.  There are some limitations, but the speed increase is on average 15 times faster.</p>
        <li>Compactness - An m.2 type SSD on average weighs about 7g, or .01 pounds, while a HDD on average weighs about 1.5 pounds.</li>
        <li>Increased Speed - An SSD is at least 15 times faster than an HDD, reaching up to 6000 input and output writes per second, compared to 400 input and output writes per second in an HDD.</li>
        <li>Reliability - SSDs are not subject to mechanical failures that are common in HDDs.</li>
        <li>Backup Speed - An SSD can be backed up 4x faster than an HDD.</li>
