  <h1>What is an SSD?</h1>
  <p>
    An SSD, or <em>solid state drive</em> is a storage medium used in computer
    hardware. What sets apart an SSD from other storage mediums, is it's complete
    lack of moving parts, hence the phrase <em>"solid state".</em>
  </p>

  <p>
    The purpose of an SSD (or any other storage medium) is to serve as a place
    where your computer can store the information it needs to function. The performance
    and reliability of a computer's storage plays a big role in the entire computer'
    performance and reliability.
