    <h1>What is an SSD?</h1>
    <p>
      An SSD, or <em>solid state drive</em> is a storage medium used in computer
      hardware. What sets apart an SSD from other storage mediums, is it's complete
      lack of moving parts, hence the phrase <em>"solid state".</em>
    </p>

    <p>
      The purpose of an SSD (or any other storage medium) is to serve as a place
      where your computer can store the information it needs to function. The performance
      and reliability of a computer's storage plays a big role in the entire computer'
      performance and reliability.
    </p>

    <h1>Why would I want an SSD?</h1>

          <li>Compactness</li>
          <li>Energy Efficiency</li>
          <li>Increased Speed</li>
          <li>Reliability</li>
          <li>No Moving Parts</li>
