        <p>
            An SSD, or <em>solid state drive</em> is a storage medium used in computer
            hardware. What sets apart an SSD from other types of storage is its complete
            lack of moving parts, hence the name "<em>solid state</em>" drive.

          The left image depicts the internals of a hard disk drive. The right image depicts the internals of a solid state drive.
          The hard disk drive features spinning platters and moving read/write heads, but
          the solid state drive has no such moving parts.

            An SSD stores the information your computer needs to function. Your computer's storage has a huge impact on it's performance, portability, and reliability.
            Let's take a look at some of the key features of a typical SSD.

                                        <p>The old storage medium, a hard disk drive, would write data magnetically to spinning platters using mechanical arms called heads.  By removing heads and platters, and switching to integrated circuit boards, there are significant increases to speed and data integrity.</p><br />
                                        <p>Hard disk drives are susceptible to mechanical failures, where parts break, and often scratch the platters. Scratches cause data corruption, and are sometimes hard to detect.  Without moving parts, there are no mechanical failures.</p><br />
                                        <p>In addition, hard disk drives could only store data as fast as the platters could spin and the heads could move.  Removing these parts allows the data to be stored as fast as the data is transmitted.  There are some limitations, but the speed increase is on average 15 times faster.</p>

                                        <p>HDD sizes come in 2.5" form factor edition, or 3.5" as the standard.  SSDs come in sizes of 1.8", 2.5" or 3.5" standard, and m.2 form factors typically range from 22mm wide by 80mm long.  That's about the size of a flash drive!</p>
                                        <p>While the dimensions might not be important, the significance shows in their weight differences.  Comparing standard sizes, an HDD weighs about 1.5 pounds, while an SSD weighs 0.20 lbs, and a form factor m.2 SSD only weight .01 lbs.  This makes SSDs far more optimal for laptops and notebooks.</p>

        <h1>Final Verdict</h1>
        <p>
            Ultimately, the decision to buy an SSD is based on your preference and actual needs.  Today the price of long term storage has decreased significantly.  It no longer costs an arm or a leg to have 500GBs or even 1000GBs of data.  The price of an SSD is more affordable than ever since its introduction to the commercial market.  An SSD is becoming a much more attractive item in the realm of computer parts.  Generally, having a computer with an SSD will exceed your expectations of computer speed.  Here are a couple factors that you should consider before making your final decision.
        </p>
        <ul id="listTim">
            <li>How much do you want to spend?</li>
            <br />
            <p>At its introduction, the price of an SSD was typically not worth the performance boost.  However, today you have the luxury of low SSD prices.  If you desire to purchase an SSD, but you are short on funds, there are lower cost options.  Currently there are SSDs that cost only $25.  They don't offer much in actual capacity, but even an 120GB SSD would be worth the investment. There are many more on the market if you need high performance and larger memory capacity, with models in the ranges of $50-$200.</p>

            <li>What is your intended use?</li>
            <br />
            <p>Maybe you are a movie collector. Only, you are a movie collector who likes digital copies of films.  Maybe you are an avid gamer who needs performance, but at a good cost. Or maybe you just want to look at photos of your grandkids.  Whatever actual desire you may have to use a computer, there is a great benefit of having an SSD.  The fact is that with variable memory sizes, increased performance, and greater portabilty an SSD would make a great addition to your computer.</p>
