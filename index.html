        <p>
            An SSD, or <em>solid state drive</em> is a storage medium used in many modern computers. What sets apart an SSD from other types of storage is its complete
            lack of moving parts, hence the name "<em>solid state</em>" drive.

          The left image shows the internals of a hard disk drive, while the right image shows the internals of a solid state drive.
          The hard disk drive features spinning platters and moving read/write heads, but
          the solid state drive has no such moving parts.

            An SSD stores the information a computer needs to function. Despite the important role computer storage plays,
            many consumers looking for a new computer tend to focus on factors such as processor speed, or screen size. However,
            failing to consider the type of storage a computer has before making a purchasing decision is a mistake. A computer's storage
            has a huge impact on its performance, portability, and reliability. With this in mind, here are some of the key features of a typical SSD:

                                          Traditional hard disk drives, or HDDs, write data to spinning platters using mechanical arms called "heads". In order to retrieve a file stored on a hard disk drive,
                                          the head must first physically move to the portion of the platter where that data is stored. Although this motion may appear instantaneous
                                          to the naked eye, it actually causes significant delay, especially when many small files in different locations are being accessed.
                                        </p>
                                        <br>
                                        <p>
                                          Because SSDs do not need to move any parts to be able to access their information, they perform significantly faster than hard disk drives when multiple files are involved.
                                          It is important to note that the majority of everyday computing involves many small files stored in different locations.
                                        </p>
                                        <br>

                                          Furthermore, hard disk drives are more susceptible to mechanical failures than SSDs. These failures are especially common in scenarios involving vibrations or shock, such as
                                          in transporting a laptop computer. SSDs are more resistant to impacts and random mechanical failures than their mechanical counterparts.

                                          Hard disk drives are often physically larger than SSDs. Pictured to the right are several SSDs scattered about a typical hard disk drive. The smaller form factor of SSDs means that computers that contain them, are typically much more compact.
                                        </p>
                                        <br>

                                          Further solidifying the SSD as the most portable internal storage medium is its weight. A typical hard disk drive (as pictured to the right) weighs about 1.5 pounds, while an SSD can weigh as little as .01 lbs.
                                        </p>

                                          The performance difference between an SSD and a hard disk drive varies depending on the type of workload. However, during typical, everyday computing SSDs outperform HDDs by a wide margin.
                                        </p>
                                        <br>
                                        <p>
                                          For example, a computer with a hard disk drive may take 30 seconds or longer to boot up, whereas the same computer with an SSD may boot up in 10 seconds or less. SSDs consitently perform common computing opertations in a fraction
                                          of the time compared to hard disk drives.
                                        </p>
                                        <br>
                                        <p>
                                          This means that everything from browsing the web, to opening an application, happens significantly faster on a solid state drive.
                                        </p>
                                    </div>

                                          Cost is another key area in which SSDs and HDDs differ. Unfortunately, SSDs are typically much more expensive than HDDs in terms of "dollars per gigabytes of storage".
                                        </p>
                                        <br>
                                        <p>
                                          As of October 2018, a performant 256 gigabyte SSD (pictured to the right) can be had for about 90 dollars. Alternatively, the same amount of money could also be used to purchase a 3 terabyte (3,000 gigabyte) hard disk drive (pictured to the right).
                                        </p>
                                        <br>
                                        <p>
                                          This difference in cost plays a huge role in deciding which form of storage is more appropriate for a given use. When huge amounts of data must be stored, hard disk drives are much more cost effective. When performance is more important
                                          than capacity, SSDs are a often a better choice.
                                        </p>
                                        <br>
                                        <p>
                                          Even though SSDs offer smaller storage capacities compared to HDDs at the same price, these capacities often satisfy the needs
                                          of most users, particularly those of mobile computers. Work requiring massive storage is typically delegated to desktop computers, where it is practical to have multiple storage drives. Desktops often have a combination of SSDs and HDDs in order to leverage the benefits of each
                                          storage medium.

            <h1>Conclusion</h1>
            <p>
                With the decreasing prices of computer storage, SSDs are becoming much more common. However, that does not mean traditional hard disk drives have lost their place in the storage industry.
                When making a decision on what computer to buy, there are primarily two factors that must be considered: the intended use, and the desired price.
            </p>
            <p>
              Years ago when SSDs were first introduced to the market, they were priced well out of reach of the majority of consumers. Since then, both SSD and HDD prices have been greatly reduced.
              Today, SSDs are most appropriate for every day computing, especially mobile computing. SSDs are unrivaled in their performance when it comes to every day computing tasks. They also offer increased portability and durability,
              making them the desired storage medium for many users.
