    <h1>What is an SSD?</h1>
    <p>
      An SSD, or <em>solid state drive</em> is a storage medium used in computer
      hardware. What sets apart an SSD from other storage mediums, is it's complete
      lack of moving parts, hence the phrase <em>"solid state".</em>

      The purpose of an SSD (or any other storage medium) is to serve as a place
      where your computer can store the information it needs to function. The performance
      and reliability of a computer's storage plays a big role in the entire computer'
      performance and reliability.

    <h1>Why would I want an SSD?</h1>
      <h2>An SSD is the next generation of computer data storage, with significant advances to its predecessor: the Hard Disk Drive.</h2>
        <h2>No Moving Parts</h2>
          <p>The old storage medium, a hard disk drive, would write data magnetically to spinning platters using mechanical arms called heads.  By removing these heads and platters, and switching to integrated circuit boards, there is a significant increase to speed and data integrity.</p>
          <p>Hard disk drives were susceptible to mechanical failures, where parts would break, and often would scratch the platters. Scratches would corrupt tha data, and would sometimes be hard to detect.  With no moving parts, there are no mechanical failures.</p>
          <p>In addition, hard disk drives could only store data as fast as the platters could spin and the heads could move.  Removing these parts allows the data to be stored as fast as the data is transmitted.  There are some limitations, but the speed increase is on average 15 times faster.</p>
        <h2>Compactness</h2>
          <p>HDD sizes could come in 2.5" as a small form factor edition, or 3.5" as the standard.  SSDs come in sizes of 1.8", 2.5" or 3.5" standard, and m.2 form factors typically range from 22mm wide by 80mm long.  That's about the size of a flash drive!</p>
          <p>While the dimensions might not be important, the significance shows in the weight difference.  Comparing standard sizes, a HDD weighs about 1.5 pounds, while an SSD weighs .20 lbs, and a form factor m.2 SSD only weight .01 lbs.  This makes SSDs far more optimal for laptops and notebooks.</p>
        <h2>Performance</h2>
          <li>Increased Speed - An SSD is at least 15 times faster than an HDD, reaching up to 6000 input and output writes per second, compared to 400 input and output writes per second in an HDD.</li>
          <li>Reliability - SSDs are not subject to mechanical failures that are common in HDDs.</li>
          <li>Backup Speed - An SSD can be backed up 4x faster than an HDD.</li>
  
      <h1>Final Verdict</h1>
      <p>
          Ultimately, the decision to buy an SSD is based on your preference and actual needs.  Today the price of long term storage has decreased significantly.  No longer does it cost an arm or a leg to have 500GB or even 1000GB of data.  The price of an SSD is more affordable than ever since its introduction to the commercial market.  An SSD is becoming a much more attractive item in the realm of computer parts.  Generally, having a computer with an SSD will exceed your expectations of computer speed.  Here are a few factors that you should consider before making your final decision.

          <li>How much do you want to spend?</li><br />

          <li>What is your intended use?</li><br />
            <p>Maybe you are a movie collector. Only, you are a movie collector who likes digital copies of films.  Maybe you are an avid gamer who needs performance but at a good cost.  Or maybe you just want to look at photos of your grandkids.</p>
            <p>Whatever actual desire you may have to use a computer, there is a great benefit of having an SSD.  The fact is that with variable memory sizes, increased performances, and greater portabilty an SSD would make a great addition to your computer. </p>
